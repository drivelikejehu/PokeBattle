## Description 
#
Welcome all trainers! Have you ever had a dispute between friends end in disaster? From calling 'shotgun' in the parking lot to the last slice of pizza, Pok√©Battle is for you! 

Our team built this project to bring friends together. With the help of [Pok√©mon API](https://pokeapi.co/), we created a modern-day pok√©mon equivalent to the coin toss. After consulting the rules and the pok√©mon chart, users can start battle. Both trainers enter their username and generate a pok√©mon each. The application will generate a winner and display the wins. Technologies include Foundation, Handlebars, Node.js, Express, MySql, and Sequelize, and Heroku for deployment. 

In creating this application, we learned about trials and tribulations of full-stack web development. This was our first experience using Sequelize to connect to our databases, as well honing our skills in navigating the Model View Controller paradigm.
